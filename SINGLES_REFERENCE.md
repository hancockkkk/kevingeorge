## To-Do List

### Immediate Priorities
- [ ] Get exact release dates for all 2025 singles
- [ ] Obtain cover art for all 2025 singles
- [ ] Verify Spotify/Apple Music/YouTube links for 2024-2025 releases
- [ ] Get cover art for 2024 singles
- [ ] Get cover art for 2023 singles

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Confirm which singles are part of "Glory Road" project vs true standalone
- [ ] Add track lengths/duration
- [ ] Add producer credits
- [ ] Add features/collaborators if any

### Questions to Verify
1. Are the "Lost Tapes" releases actually from those years or is that just the subtitle?
2. Should "Glory Road" singles (2022) be on the singles page or in their own section?
3. Any upcoming 2026 releases to prepare for?
